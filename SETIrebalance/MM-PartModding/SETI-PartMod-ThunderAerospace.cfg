{
	@description = A life support recycling module that extracts carbon from carbon dioxide, leaving pure breathable oxygen. It works by using the Bosch reaction. Rated for up to 3 kerbals and stretches breathing air reserves by a factor of about 7.6, since kerbals produce not enough carbon-dioxide to let the converter run at 100% capacity. With 3 kerbals, it uses about 374 ec per hour and produces about 16.08 oxygen.

	@description = A life support recycling module that extracts carbon from carbon dioxide, leaving pure breathable oxygen. It works by using the Bosch reaction. Packaged in a larger structure for easier use with massive rockets and space stations, with the added advantage of a faster conversion rate. Rated for up to 9 kerbals and stretches breathing air reserves by a factor of about 7.6, since kerbals produce not enough carbon-dioxide to let the converter run at 100% capacity. With 9 kerbals, it uses about 1121 ec per hour and produces about 48.24 oxygen.
